=head1 NAME
where the components of r and r 0 are expressed with respect to the same coordinate system (right
portion of Fig. 4.1). In either case, the coordinates are transformed. The transformation in the form
0
(r) = R(φ)r is a passive transformation, leaving the vector unchanged but changing the coordinate
axes, while r 0 = R(φ)r is an active transformation, changing the vector with respect to the same
coordinate system. It’s not necessary to make the notational distinction in Eq. (4.1). Rotating the
coordinate axes counterclockwise by the angle φ is equivalent to rotating the vector r clockwise
through φ. The components of r 0 in an active rotation are the same as those of (r) 0 in a passive
rotation except for the sign of the angle: a positive angle in the active transformation is opposite to
that for the passive.

=head2 DESCRIPTION
Rotational symmetry
Symmetries have two aspects: a transformation and something invariant under the transformation.
For rotations the distance to the rotation axis is preserved: x 02 + y 02 = (x cos φ + y sin φ) 2 +
(−x sin φ + y cos φ) 2 = x 2 + y 2 . The terms x 2 + y 2 can be generated from the inner product r T r:
