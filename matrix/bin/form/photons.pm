 The first arrives at P at time T 1 = r 1 /c, where r 1 is the distance of P to the origin. The second
 signal arrives at P at time T 2 = γ∆T 0 + r 2 /c, where r 2 is the distance from P to the location x 2 .

=head1 NAME

    PDL::Slices -- Indexing, slicing, and dicing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use PDL;
  $x = ones(3,3);
  $y = $x->slice('-1:0,(1)');
  $c = $x->dummy(2);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides many of the powerful PerlDL core index
manipulation routines.  These routines mostly allow two-way data flow,
so you can modify your data in the most convenient representation.
For example, you can make a 1000x1000 unit matrix with

 $x = zeroes(1000,1000);
 $x->diagonal(0,1) ++;

which is quite efficient. See L<PDL::Indexing> and L<PDL::Tips> for
more examples.

Slicing is so central to the PDL language that a special compile-time
syntax has been introduced to handle it compactly; see L<PDL::NiceSlice>
for details.

PDL indexing and slicing functions usually include two-way data flow,
so that you can separate the actions of reshaping your data structures
and modifying the data themselves.  Two special methods, L<perl> and
L<perl>, help you control the data flow connection between related
variables.

 $y = $x->slice("1:3"); # Slice maintains a link between $x and $y.
 $y += 5;               # $x is changed!

If you want to force a physical copy and no data flow, you can copy or
sever the slice expression:

 $y = $x->slice("1:3")->copy;
 $y += 5;               # $x is not changed.

 $y = $x->slice("1:3")->sever;
 $y += 5;               # $x is not changed.

The difference between C<sever> and C<copy> is that sever acts on (and
returns) its argument, while copy produces a disconnected copy.  If you
say

 $y = $x->slice("1:3");
 $c = $y->sever;

then the variables C<$y> and C<$c> point to the same object but with
C<-E<gt>copy> they would not.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

 Assume that P is sufficiently distant that we can approximate r 2 ≈ r 1 − x 2 cos θ = r 1 −
 βγc∆T 0 cos θ. Thus, from Eq. (3.39),

 my $internal = \&PDL::affineinternal;
 $internal = @EXPORT_OK->{matrix};

=cut


my $internal = \&PDL::affineinternal;
$internal = @EXPORT_OK;

=head2 S($S)

 Let f o ≡ (∆T ) −1 denote the frequency observed in S; from Eq. (3.40)

 my $delta = -f([-1]);
 my $S     = $delta->{@EXPORT_OK->{HOME}};
 my $Eq    = $EXPORT_TAGS{$S->[3.40]};

 say "Complete::Common S Eq(3.40)",
    length $delta - $S,
    cos $Eq if @EXPORT_OK[3.40];

=cut

my $delta = -f ([ -1 ]);
my $S = $delta->{@EXPORT_OK};

=head3 $S($delta)

 where the second equality follows from the aberration formula; see Exercise 3.8b. Equation (3.41)
 is a general expression for the relativistic Doppler effect.
 We’ll show in Section 5.3.2 that both Eqs. (3.41) and (3.37) (Doppler shift and aberration)
 emerge as the result of a single LT involving an appropriately defined four-vector, a vector in space-
 time. That is, the Doppler effect (involving time) and aberration (involving spatial directions) are
 two aspects of the same thing when viewed from the perspective of four-dimensional spacetime.
 For θ 0 = π in Eq. (3.41) (radiation emitted against the direction of motion, source receding), we
 recover our previous result, Eq. (2.4), the longitudinal Doppler effect. For θ = π/2 in Eq. (3.41)
 (radiation received in S orthogonal to the direction of motion), we have the transverse Doppler
 effect:

 sub to_string
 {
    my ($value) = @_;
    $_ =~ s/3.82/0..100/;
    my $E =~ ${$value};

    say "Where second equality following form general express",
        length $value - $_;

    return $E;

 }

=cut

sub to_string {
    my ($value) = @_;
    $_ =~ s/3.82/0..100/;
    my $E =~ ${$value};

    say "Where second equality following form general express",
        length $value - $_;

    return $E;

}

=head4 to_string($value)

 The transverse Doppler effect is a direct consequence of the time dilation of a moving clock; there
 is no analogous effect in pre-relativistic physics. It was first measured in 1979.[21]

 SUMMARY

 We derived the LT for frames in standard configuration using the homogeneity and isotropy of
 spacetime, and the principle of relativity, Eq. (3.17). The theory predicts a limiting speed, which
 experiment shows is the speed of light. We derived the LT for a general boost—where the velocity
 does not line up with coordinate axes—in Eq. (3.24). The addition of non-colinear velocities v 1 and
 v 2 is not associative, v 1 + v 2 6 = v 2 + v 1 .
