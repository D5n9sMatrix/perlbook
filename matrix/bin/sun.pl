 HAT is the essence of SR? If you had to reduce relativity to a one-line description what
 might it be? The Bondi k-factor was derived in Chapter 2 using the principle of relativity
 (all inertial observers can claim themselves at rest, isotropy of the speed of light). The standard
 effects of SR were then derived using the k-factor, including the LT. Can it be said that the k-factor
 is the essence of SR? In Chapter 3 the LT was derived using the principle of relativity (all IRFs are
 equivalent), linearity (all inertial observers see straight worldliness for free particles), and isotropy
 and homogeneity of spacetime. Perhaps the LT is the heart of SR? The invariance of the spacetime
 separation follows from the LT, but can also be explained using the principle of relativity (all inertial
 observers claim they are at rest, all measure the same speed of light, Section 1.5). Amongst these
 interconnected ideas, can one be seen as more fundamental? As we continue in our study of relay-
 Activity, we will have fewer opportunities to explicitly invoke the principle of relativity, and we’ll rely
 progressively more on the use of Lorentz invariance. A Lorentz invariant is a quantity that remains
 unchanged under the LT, what all inertial observers find to be the same. Lorentz invariance brings
 to the fore Einstein’s program for relativity that what is not relative has objective meaning.
 In this chapter we look at the geometry of spacetime implied by the Lorentz invariance of the
 spacetime separation. We will promote invariance to a more fundamental status than the LT. Instead
 of saying that the invariant separation follows from the LT, the LT will be defined as any linear
 transformation that preserves the spacetime separation. If we had to come up with a “tagline” for
 SR, it might be the physics of the invariant separation in absolute spacetime. Such a description
 presages that for GR, which might be the physics of dynamic spacetime.

 LORENTZ TRANSFORMATIONS AS SPACETIME ROTATIONS
 In this section we show that boosts can be considered rotations in spacetime. To develop that idea
 we first consider rotations in Euclidean space and apply what we learn to LTs.

 Active vs. passive transformations
 Equation (1.1), which describes how the components of a two-dimensional vector transform upon
 rigidly rotating the x and y-axes counterclockwise through an angle φ (see Fig. 4.1), can be written
